# Lift

Intro
-----------------
Have you ever had to scroll though a long webpage? Whether it be Facebook or Reddit,
Lift is a Chrome Extension that can help you quickly navigate to a previously marked location!

How to use
---------------
Select/highlight an actionable item on a webpage, then use 
Lift's interactive buttons to mark that location. Lift's "Go Up" and "Go Down" buttons will quickly navigate you to your designated locations.

Current Issue
--------------
*   When marking items of multiple types (ie. plain text and link), the items will not be highlighted. 
However the lift feature will still work, bringing you to the same location on the webpage.
*   Lift is currently not actively supported/updated, future improve may come.
